### Pixel Link

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) that demonstrates how 
to send and receive payloads using screen pixels. The
data is chunked and encoded into 3-byte pixels arranged
in rows, creating a full-duplex communication pipe
between instances. 

TLDR; This method leverages screen pixel manipulation
as a tranmissio medium, allowing bidirectional data
exchange between two systems.
